Initial Request: You described the need to create a Python program for a Pi 3 to analyze /Solis/config/SolisManagerExecutionHistory.csv. 
You specified the date format, the columns of interest (3-Unit price, 8-Imported kWh, 9-Exported kWh), 
the need to summarize between start/end dates, and the specific calculations required 
(total import, low/high price import kWh, total/low/high import cost, export value, final billed cost).

Refinement 1: You clarified that the unit cost information was in pence and that the file path was relative to the user's path. 
You also requested to list the rows excluded by the date range filter.

Refinement 2: You asked to count the number of rows that contributed to the low-price and high-price data points within the selected period.

Refinement 3 (Major Change): You requested the summary be presented on a daily basis for the selected interval, instead of just an overall total.

Refinement 4 (Output & Correction): You stated you no longer needed the list of excluded rows. 
You asked to fit the daily summaries onto one row per day. 
You also explicitly requested setting the column indices: IMPORTED_KWH_COL_IDX = 8 and EXPORTED_KWH_COL_IDX = 9.

Refinement 5: You asked to add back in columns for low cost power and high cost power (the kWh and cost breakdowns) into the single-line daily summary format.
